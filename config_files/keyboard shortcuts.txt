OSX
----
Make sure the 'caps lock' key is mapped to produce the control (^) key.
Use system preferences / Keyboard / Modifier keys... if necessary.

ctrl left / right
  switch to left / right space

shift-f11
  show spaces

f11
  move other windows out of the way (temporarily) and show desktop

move mouse to bottom right of screen
  start screen saver


Eclipse
---------------------
Import the latest preferences file by selecting File/Import/General/Preferences/Next;
from preference file ~/android_development/android_base/config_files/jeff.epf


ctrl space
  content assist

ctrl .
  cycle through suggestions of content assist

cmd .
  advance to next issue (e.g., compile error)

cmd 1
  attempt 'quick fix' of error (often there is a single obvious fix
  to a compile problem)

cmd D
  delete current line

cmd shift F
  Format source file

ctrl X
  Open a type (e.g. a class); saves hunting for it in the Package Explorer;
  I have added this to be equivalent to the built-in cmd shift T

cmd /
  toggle disabling selected lines (or current line if none selected)

cmd shift L   (twice)
  display keyboard mappings

double click on word with mouse
  selects word


f4 f3
  find next occurrence of selected word (f4 isn't really required,
  but other editors I use require it)

cmd J  ...then type something...
  does incremental search; finds occurrence of what you've typed; can be followed by f3

cmd F
  search within file

cmd P
  search within project

cmd return
  go to definition of cursor element

f2
  shows documentation (Javadoc) for cursor element

cmd [
  go back to previous edit position

cmd w
  close current tab

option up/down
  move current line up or down

cmd G
  go to line number (you can often double click on lines with errors,
  such as JUnit test results, to go to lines as well)

f9
  repeat last run (unit test, application, whatever)

option f9
  run single JUnit test at cursor position (doesn't work for Android unit tests!)

f10
  close perspective (i.e. after running test or application) to return views to 'edit' mode

f5
  refresh files (do this after selecting a package within the Package
  Explorer; this is sometimes necessary after doing a git pull)



Try installing MouseFeed plugin (install site:  http://download.sigasi.com/update/mousefeed/   )

This shows a little popup every time you use a mouse or menu command for something for which
a keyboard shortcut is available.  A great idea!
