  attempt 'quick fix' of error (often there is a single obvious fix
  to a compile problem)

cmd D
  delete current line

  I have added this to be equivalent to the built-in cmd shift T

  toggle disabling selected lines (or current line if none selected)

cmd shift L   (twice)
  display keyboard mappings

double click on word with mouse
  selects word

  find next occurrence of selected word (f4 isn't really required,
  but other editors I use require it)

cmd P
  search within project

cmd return
  go to definition of word at cursor

cmd [
  go back to previous edit position

cmd w
  close current tab

option up/down

  go to line number (you can often double click on lines with errors,
  such as JUnit test results, to go to lines as well)

f9
  repeat last run (unit test, application, whatever)

f5
  refresh files (do this after selecting a package within the Package
  Explorer; this is sometimes necessary after doing a git pull)
